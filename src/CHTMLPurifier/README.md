CHTMLPurifier, a wrapper for HTMLPurifier
=====================================================

The software package `HTMLPurifier` is available at http://htmlpurifier.org/.
The Lydia class `CHTMLPurifier` is a wrapper that integrates the `HTMLPurifier` with Lydia. The 
intention is that all usage of `HTMLPurifier` should go through `CHTMLPurifier`.
